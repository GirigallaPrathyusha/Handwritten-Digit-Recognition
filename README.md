# Handwritten Digit Recognition 

A GUI-based application for recognizing handwritten digits using deep learning for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Features
- Interactive drawing canvas for digit input
- Real-time digit recognition
- Built with Python and Tkinter for the GUI
- Uses a pre-trained neural network model

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition-gui.git
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition-gui
2. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the application:
   python digit_recognition_gui.py

1. Draw a digit (0-9) on the canvas using your mouse

2. Click "Recognize" to see the prediction

3. Click "Clear" to start over

Model
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset

Architecture: Simple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Accuracy: ~98% on test data
